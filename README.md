# Sen-Making-and-Explanation
This is the dataset for <Does It Make Sense? And Why? A Pilot Study for Sense Making and Explanation> , which has been accepted by ACL-2019.

You can download the paper through https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00363 .

You can call this dataset as **Sen-Making**.

**It is better to check SemEval2020-task4: https://github.com/wangcunxiang/SemEval2020-Task4-Commonsense-Validation-and-Explanation, because it has more data (train&valid data) and one extra subtask.**

# Amendent on the Paper
I sincerely apologize for making the 'perplexity' mistake in the paper.

We use score = (p_{1}*p_{2}...p_{n})^{-1/n} =(\prod_{i=1}^{n}(p_{i} | sentence))^{-1/n} to calculate each sentence's score. 
 
We use the probabilities of the all words of one sentence to calculate it.
We didn't think about using perplexity. We only wanted to use p_{i}|(sentence) to design a metric. But after we created the formula, we mistakenly mapped it to perplexity.

We have revised the paper on this mistake, so please read the reversed paper in arXiv https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00363 rather than the paper in Anthology.

# SemEval-2020

We will hold a contest in SemEval2020 based on this study. This contest will provide a **Training set** and a **Development set**of these tasks.

You can check task 4 - Commonsense Validation and Explanation in http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2020/index.php?id=tasks.

Looking forward to your participation!

    abstract = "Introducing common sense to natural language understanding systems has received increasing research attention. It remains a fundamental question on how to evaluate whether a system has the sense-making capability. Existing benchmarks measure common sense knowledge indirectly or without reasoning. In this paper, we release a benchmark to directly test whether a system can differentiate natural language statements that make sense from those that do not make sense. In addition, a system is asked to identify the most crucial reason why a statement does not make sense. We evaluate models trained over large-scale language modeling tasks as well as human performance, showing that there are different challenges for system sense-making.",
